spec:
  # the number of GameServers to keep Ready or Allocated in this Fleet. Defaults to 0
  replicas: 1
  # defines how GameServers are organised across the cluster.
  # Options include:
  # "Packed" (default) is aimed at dynamic Kubernetes clusters, such as cloud providers, wherein we want to bin pack
  # resources
  # "Distributed" is aimed at static Kubernetes clusters, wherein we want to distribute resources across the entire
  # cluster
  scheduling: Packed
  # a GameServer template - see:
  # https://agones.dev/site/docs/reference/gameserver/ for all the options
  # strategy:
    # The replacement strategy for when the GameServer template is changed. Default option is "RollingUpdate",
    # "RollingUpdate" will increment by maxSurge value on each iteration, while decrementing by maxUnavailable on each
    # iteration, until all GameServers have been switched from one version to another.
    # "Recreate" terminates all non-allocated GameServers, and starts up a new set with the new details to replace them.
    # type: RollingUpdate
    # Only relevant when `type: RollingUpdate`
    # rollingUpdate:
      # the amount to increment the new GameServers by. Defaults to 25%
      # maxSurge: 25%
      # the amount to decrements GameServers by. Defaults to 25%
      # maxUnavailable: 25%
